# Graph Algorithms with Embeddings

This section explains how graph embeddings can be used to accelerate traditional graph algorithms. Graph embeddings are low-dimensional vector representations of nodes that capture the structural properties of the graph. By using these embeddings, we can often transform complex graph operations into simple vector operations, leading to significant performance improvements.

## Algorithm Overview

| Algorithm | Traditional Approach | Embedding-Based Approach | Speed Improvement |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Personalized PageRank | Matrix iterations | Vector similarity | 5-10x |
| Node Classification | Graph traversal | Neural network | 2-5x |
| Community Detection | Graph clustering | Vector clustering | 10-20x |
| Link Prediction | Path-based metrics | Vector operations | 3-8x |

## How Embeddings Improve Performance

### Space Efficiency
- **Dimension Reduction**: Instead of storing the full adjacency matrix (O(n²)), embeddings store a fixed-size vector per node (O(n·d) where d << n)
- **Memory Locality**: Vector operations have better cache utilization compared to graph traversal
- **Sparse to Dense**: Convert sparse graph operations to dense matrix operations, which are more efficient on modern hardware

### Time Efficiency
- **Parallel Processing**: Vector operations are highly parallelizable on modern CPUs/GPUs
- **Approximation**: Trade exact solutions for very good approximations with much better scaling
- **Precomputation**: Most complex graph structure information is captured during the embedding process

## Detailed Algorithm Descriptions

### Personalized PageRank
::: core.algorithms.embedding_algorithms.ApproximatePersonalizedPageRank
    handler: python
    selection:
      members:
        - __init__
        - compute_pagerank

**How Embeddings Help**: Instead of iterative matrix multiplication (O(m·k) for k iterations), we use vector similarity computations (O(n·d)) where d is the embedding dimension. This is especially effective for large, sparse graphs.

### Node Classification
::: core.algorithms.embedding_algorithms.FastNodeClassification
    handler: python
    selection:
      members:
        - __init__
        - classify_nodes

**How Embeddings Help**: Rather than expensive graph feature extraction and neighbor traversal, we use the embedding vectors as ready-to-use feature vectors for classification, reducing the complexity from O(n·k·m) to O(n·d).

### Community Detection
::: core.algorithms.embedding_algorithms.EfficientCommunityDetection
    handler: python
    selection:
      members:
        - __init__
        - detect_communities

**How Embeddings Help**: Traditional community detection often requires examining the entire graph structure repeatedly. With embeddings, we can cluster the embedding vectors directly, reducing complexity from O(n²·log(n)) to O(n·log(n)).

### Link Prediction
::: core.algorithms.embedding_algorithms.LinkPrediction
    handler: python
    selection:
      members:
        - __init__
        - predict_links

**How Embeddings Help**: Instead of computing path-based metrics (O(n³)), we can use vector operations on node embeddings (O(n·d²)) to predict potential links.
